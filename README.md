# Elections Ad Spending Analysis with Python

Welcome to the **Elections Ad Spending Analysis with Python** project! If you're highly active on Facebook and Instagram, you've likely noticed election ads from various political parties, especially BJP and INC. These parties invest heavily in their election campaigns. Recently, I gathered data from Meta ads to analyze how much each political party spent on Instagram and Facebook ads during the Indian elections of 2024 across different states. This analysis explores how this spending influenced voting patterns.

The dataset used for this analysis consists of three files:

1. **Advertisers Dataset**: Provides insights into which pages (parties or organizations) spend money on election ads and the volume of ads they run.
2. **Locations Dataset**: Shows how much money was spent on ads in different locations, indicating where the campaigns focused their efforts.
3. **Results Dataset**: Provides actual voting data, showing how many people voted in each area and the percentage of voter turnout.
